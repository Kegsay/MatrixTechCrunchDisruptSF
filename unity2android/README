requires a config file which looks like:
key=value
key=value

Required keys: 
unity-temp   :  Path to the autogenned android unity files in Temp/StagingArea
android      :  Path to the android project (..)
unity-lib    :  Path to the unity android library in Contents/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer


Then run ./u2a.py and it will dump the stuff from unity into the assets dir of the android project.
It will also check to make sure you have the classes for things like UnityPlayer by inspecting the
classpath of the android project. If it whines at you, then add External JAR and select classes.jar
located in unity >>> Contents/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/development/bin/classes.jar

You will then need to link 1 project with the android one: the one in unity2android/unity-temp-dir
